# -GameRuleSet-Bahb’s D100 System

A Concept of Game Design

Basic Premise

The basic premise of Bahb’s d100 system is to be able to build a set of rules for any game type or system, and customize its complexity for whatever your group is comfortable with.

Bahb released this because he did not want to design or publish works under the d20 OGL any longer. It is free to use and implement for any party, including for commercial use, as long as and published product includes the following  text:

‘This work is freely derived from Bahb’s d100 system. Use of this system is free including for commercial use, as long as this disclaimer is included in the body of the text. Donations to Bahb for this can be made to paypal.me/bahbsilunt ‘

Core Mechanics

Attributes

Attributes are the core building blocks of characters with values from 1-100 for most characters (and for humans in settings with multiple races). In an arbitrary form, it represents what percentage of humans you are superior to.

Attributes should be broad enough concepts to be widely applied.

Derived Statistics

Derived Statistics represent fundamental parts of characters that are derived from your Attributes. They will represent things like how much you can do, how fast you can move, and how much damage you can take.

All of your Attributes should be referenced in your Derived Statistics, or you should consider going back and combining attributes and degrading the original attributes to derived statistics.


Skills
Skills are where we get into what characters do. Things like attack, fix stuff, hear noises, and about anything an adventuresome type might try to do in your setting. Each Skill should still be general enough for at least two specializations.

Specialties
Specialties are where we get into the nitty-gritty that allows each character to be a little different than the others, even in their archetypes.

You can layer skill specialties down as many layers as you like, but returns should be diminished. Also, at the first layer of Specialties, you should at least consider Effects, below, but it might make sense to go down a layer or two further before introducing them, or even introducing different types of FX at different layers.

Effects (FX)

Effects or FX represent where special abilities, super powers, races, magic, psionics, reality bending, and even such mundane things like languages and moral standing are considered. These should refer to skills, Statistics and Attributes up the line or are static effects.

Skill Tests

Attribute points(or Derived Stat) + Skill Points + Specialty Points +/- Modifiers = Skill Value

You use Skill Value in two basic ways.

Static: You roll a d100 and are trying to roll BELOW your Skill Value. The lower your roll the better your margin of success. This would be appropriate for actions where nothing can consciously resist your efforts. (Examples: Painting a Fence, Picking Flowers, Making a Potion)

Opposed: You are rolling against either an opposing skill roll or a fixed target number assigned by the GM. You roll a d100 and add your Skill Value to it. You are trying to roll ABOVE the opposing roll or target number.

Either way, each 10 points you are above or below the target, you get a raise on the skill check.





Chapter 1: Creating a Character

Stage 0  Concept



Stage 1 Basic Attributes

These represent the most basic building blocks of every character. These numbers range from 1 to 100, unless the Game Master includes Racial FX. A 1 Represents a complete lack of aptitude or handicap, while a 100 represents the pinnacle of human ability. It also represents what percentage of humans you have a better Attribute than. 


Regardless of the number of Basic Attributes the Game Master assigns, the starting number of points is 100. At each advance, the number of points is 10% of your total points at each Stage 1, 3, and 4. Any points not used in this stage have a multiplier applied and are used in Stage 2 or beyond.



Sample System

Strength (Str)
	Strength measures your character’s muscle and physical power. 	
Dexterity (Dex)
	Dexterity measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance. 
Constitution (Con)
	Constitution represents your character’s health, stamina and resistance to disease and toxins. 
Intelligence (Int)
	Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. 
Wisdom (Wis)
	Wisdom describes a character’s willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. 
Charisma (Cha)
	Charisma measures a character’s force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. 
Magic (Mag)
	Magic measures a character's inherent ability to use and resist magic.
Stage 2: Derived Statistics
Derived Statistics represent building blocks of your character slightly more complex than the basic statistics.They are all also derived from basic attributes, hence their name.
Every system will need four basic components. Anything else is optional to the system. 
Firstly, you need Health or Hit Points, or whatever you want to call it. This should be derived from a combination of physical and mental resistance abilities. It should start out two to three times an average characters
Secondly, you need a movement speed statistic. Call it Move or Walk or whatever. It represents the number of yards or meters your character moves at a brisk walking pace in one minute. It should be derived from a combination of physical strength and agility. A normal person should have a number around 100.
Thirdly, you need Initiative. You could call it Action Speed or Action Points or something along those lines, but it represents how much your character can act in one minute.
Lastly you need one or more statistics to represent defenses and/or an ability to take damage. Call it Defense, or Soak or what have you. You might have different stats for normal and FX defense.
Optional types of statistics to include here might also include some sort of Fatigue, to track extra effort; the splitting of Basic statistics into component parts (carrying vs striking strength, perception vs. willpower mental vs physical charisma etc), resistance to types of attacks, and some sort of mana or psychic points to cover appropriate FX abilities.
Make sure to refer to all of your Basic Attributes in your Derived Statistics. If you can’t seem to justify a Basic Attribute in this way, maybe it should be a Derived Statistic instead.
When calculating the multiplier from Stage 1 to Stage 2 points, divide the number of Derived Statistics by the number of Basic Attributes and apply normal rounding rules to numbers over 0.5. That is the multiplier. If the number is below 0.5, express it as a divisor instead, and round that to the nearest whole number.




Sample System
Multiply your remaining Basic Attribute points by 2. Keep track of all points you assign to each Statistic.
Hit Points
Hit Points represent your ability to take damage without dying. If you are out of Hit Points, you must make Survive skill rolls each minute or die, with a target number equal to your negative Hit Points.
Your Hit Points start as Strength + Constitution + Wisdom and you may raise that by 1 per point.
Move
Move represents your ability to move. Specifically it measures your ability to move in yards or meters in one minute without breaking into a run. Once you run out of Move in a turn, it costs Fatigue instead.
Your move starts as Strength + Dexterity + Constitution and you may raise that by 1 per point.
Initiative
Initiative represents your ability to act and how quickly you do. You spend it in combat to perform actions.
Initiative starts at Dexterity + Intelligence and you may raise that by 1 per point.
Mana
Mana represents your inherent ability to cast spells and activate magical effects. You spend it to cast and enhance spells and activate some magical items.
Mana starts at Constitution + Charisma + Magic and you may raise that by 1 per point.
Fatigue
Fatigue represents your ability to exert yourself above and beyond. You will spend it to hit harder, move faster, or lift more than you should.
Fatigue starts at Constitution + Wisdom and you may raise that by 1 per point.
Luck
Luck represents that intangible quality that keeps you alive when you shouldn’t be and when you accomplish things you shouldn’t be able to do.
Luck starts at 1 point per 10 full points in all Basic Statistics, combined. You may raise that by 1 per 4 points.

Willpower
Willpower represents your ability to resist mental influences, including magical ones. Willpower will represent the target number opponents will roll against to influence you.
Willpower starts at Wisdom + 20 and you may raise that by 1 per point.
Fortitude
Fortitude represents your ability to resist poisons, diseases, and magical effects that sap your strength. Fortitude will represent the target number opponents will roll to affect you.
Fortitude starts at Constitution + 20 and you may raise that by 1 per point.
Reflexes
Reflexes represent your sixth sense at avoiding traps and magical effects that you can dodge. Reflexes will represent the target number opponents will have to roll to affect you.
Reflexes start at Dexterity + 20 and you may raise that by 1 per point.
Defense
Defense represents your ability to avoid and resist attacks. Defense will represent the target number opponents will have to roll to successfully attack you.
Defense starts at Intelligence + Dexterity and you may raise that by 1 per 2 points.
Physical Soak
Physical Soak represents how much damage from attacks, falls, etc you can take before it affects you. You reduce damage from all incoming sources by either your Physical or Magical Soak.
Your Physical Soak is (Strength + Constitution + Wisdom) / 10, rounding normally and you may raise that by 1 per 10 points.
Magical Soak
Magical Soak represents how much damage from spells and magical effects you can take before it affects you. You reduce damage from all incoming sources by either your Physical or Magical Soak.
Your Magical Soak is (Constitution + Wisdom + Magic) / 10, rounding normally and you may raise that by 1 per 10 points.
Stage 3: Skills
Skills are where we get into what a character can do. 
Try to be general enough to allow for at least one degree of speciality for each skill (rather than spot, listen, and smell, make it Perception or Awareness and make spot, listen et al specialties of that more general skill- or you could make spot have day/night specialties or you could go for optional complexities, explained in Specialties below.)
The most basic skills to include for any d100 game include:
-one or more melee striking skills
-one or more ranged striking skills
-one or more perception/awareness skills
-one or more lore/knowledge skills
-if Magical FX are included, one or more skills to represent magical powers
-one or more movement skills
-one or more social interaction skills
-one or more crafting skills
You may also include whatever kind of flavoring and character building skills as you want (Creative Writing, Languages, Literacy, Gambling, Board Games, Military Strategy, etc). If you want to include active defenses, these are also typically skills.

When calculating from Stage 2 to Stage 3 Points, divide the number of Skills by the number of Basic Attributes and apply normal rounding rules to numbers over 0.5. That is the multiplier. If the number is below 0.5, express it as a divisor instead, and round that to the nearest whole number.
You may exclude certain skills from the calculation above. In the sample game, we calculated points excluding Dodge, Expert, and Spellcraft.



Sample Game
Multiply your remaining Derived Statistics points by 3. Keep track of all points assigned to each skill. To select a skill with a star, you must burn one point from your total to assign the first point. Track this separately during character creation.
You may not have a skill higher than its primary connected Attribute. You must have at least 1 point in a skill to select any Specialties, and you must have at least 1 point in each specialty below the current layer to select that layer.

Stage 4: Specialties and FX
This is where we get nitty-gritty and open up customization so no two characters should have to be exactly alike. You should have been thinking about Specialties and how many layers of those there would be while designing your skills. But if not, go back and assign at least two specialties to each skill. If you can’t seem to manage that, consider condensing skills and degrading the original skill idea to a specialty.
At the first or subsequent levels of specialization, you will also want to divert the players into various Effects/FX.
At the basic level, all characters should have a basic array of special techniques they can learn to hit harder and/or more often and a handful of languages to learn. Highly recommended are social standing modifiers- Wealth, Rank, Income, Connections.
Also to consider for access without too onerous restrictions might include Allies (player directed NPCs), and Talents (bonuses to specific skills or powers in specific situations).
Failed concepts for Attributes, Derived Statistics, and Skills might find their home in FX instead as well.
Another type of FX to consider is the Gatekeeper FX. An FX that’s primary goal is to block access to other FX ‘beyond’ or ‘above’ it. It may also function as an expensive version of one of the basic talents above.
And then we get into the weeds. Super Powers, Magic, Psionics, Cybernetics, Aliens, Monsters, Fantasy Races, and all the other unique trappings of your setting. This is where you make or break game balance and determine late campaign character goals.
At the first stage of Specialties (or whatever stage or stages) you include the copies of specialties, you can account for (or not, or account for some and not others) FX options. Otherwise double stage 3 skill points at stage 4 and again at each subsequent layer of specialization.
Sample Game
Multiply your remaining Skill Points by 4. You will be using these for specialties, and FX abilities.
Any unused points at the first layer of specialties will be doubled and used on subsequent layers until all layers or points are exhausted. 
You cannot save points for later use, but you can spend them to partially buy an FX and finish buying at the next or later advance.

FX
FX is really hard to quantify or give general advice for and this will be the area you will have to do the most revisions and playtesting around. As explained in Character Creation: Stage 4,
‘At the first or subsequent levels of specialization, you will also want to divert the players into various Effects/FX.’
At the basic level, all characters should have a basic array of special techniques they can learn to hit harder and/or more often and a handful of languages to learn. Highly recommended are social standing modifiers- Wealth, Rank, Income, Connections.
Also to consider for access without too onerous restrictions might include Allies (player directed NPCs), and Talents (bonuses to specific skills or powers in specific situations).
Failed concepts for Attributes, Derived Statistics, and Skills might find their home in FX instead as well.
Another type of FX to consider is the Gatekeeper FX. An FX that’s primary goal is to block access to other FX ‘beyond’ or ‘above’ it. It may also function as an expensive version of one of the basic talents above.
And then we get into the weeds. Super Powers, Magic, Psionics, Cybernetics, Aliens, Monsters, Fantasy Races, and all the other unique trappings of your setting. This is where you make or break game balance and determine late campaign character goals.
At the first stage of Specialties (or whatever stage or stages) you include the copies of specialties, you can account for (or not, or account for some and not others) FX options. Otherwise double stage 3 skill points at stage 4 and again at each subsequent layer of specialization.’
—

If you are converting ideas from another system, you are going to inherit as much of their rules from their system as you want for flavor and game balance and discard the rest. This is a fine way to source specific FX ideas and comparative points costs and requirements from, even if you aren’t inspired to convert an entire system. 
If you aren’t using intellectual property for the basis of your setting, and aren’t converting whole chapters of other game designers' work ability verbatim title for ability title and description and only minimal work to design or convert the effects of the FX, you should be fine to publish under principles of fair use- commentary, criticism, and inspiration. 
If you are just copy pasting or building a home game from, oh say, famous movie or television properties, don’t publish it. Use it at home. Or learn the painful process of licensing rights from holders.







Sample Game
General FX
Combat FX
Melee Attack FX

Wealth (10/level)
Prerequisites: Charisma 5
For each level of Wealth, you double your starting money. Wealth also modifies any Income and Debt.
Residual Income (1/level)
For Each level of Residual Income you gain 1% of your starting money (as modified by Wealth) each month. This represents dividends from stock, income from landholdings, or some kind of annuity, royalty, or pension.

Earned Income (1/level)
Prerequisites: Charisma 5, Negotiation 5
For each level of Earned income, you earn an additional 1% of your starting money (as modified by Wealth) each week you work a Wealth-appropriate job.

Allies/Leadership (10/level, with modifiers)
Prerequisites: Charisma 15
You have one or more Allies- a friendly NPC. You may select Allies multiple times, each of which will be different. As a default Ally gives you one Ally.
For each level of Allies, your Ally has 10% of your points at each stage.
You may select Allies multiple times. Each one is a unique Ally or group.
Ally Modifiers
Multiples/Leadership: You have multiple allies with the same statistics. Each level doubles your number of allies (i.e. to 2, then 4, then 8, then 16) and modifies the final cost of Allies by +50%.  Example: Leadership 2 provides 4 allies and doubles (+100%) the final cost.
Frequency of Appearance: This is expressed as a percentage and acts as a multiplier for the cost. An ally that is some kind of wearable gear or never leaves for any reason has 100%. A buddy who hangs out when he can but has a sick mom and a part time job might be 60% and you multiply the cost by 0.6. Someone who stops by 4 times a year would be 1% and you multiply the cost by 0.01. Your GM rolls at or under the frequency of appearance at the beginning of each session. Your ally is not available on a failure.
Loyalty: This is expressed as a percentage and acts as a multiplier for the cost. Someone who would jump in front of a bullet for you without a second thought is 100%. Someone who would sell out their mother for 50 cents is 1% and you multiply the cost by 0.01. Whenever the ally is bribed, threatened, or otherwise enticed to betray the character, the GM rolls at or under Loyalty or the Ally goes for the Betrayal. When an Ally betrays a character, that character gets an appropriate Enemy and the character also may gain an advance for every full 10 FX points spent on the Ally the next time advancement can occur, and 5 Advance Points for each remaining FX points below 10.
Controllability: This is expressed as a percentage and acts as a multiplier for the cost. A mindless zombie with no free will has a Controllability of 100%, while a wild card maverick or wild animal who adopted the PC as a child or packmate has a 1% and you multiply the cost by 0.01. Whenever the GM thinks the Ally would like to do something other than ordered, the GM rolls at or under Controllability or the Ally does what the GM thinks the Ally wants to do.
(Example: Bahb wants a small army of minions of moderate power and solid loyalty. He goes for 5 levels for 50% of his point total. He also selects Leadership 5 for a 250% modifier to the final total and a total of 32 minions. Now they almost always show up (Frequency 88%), are a combination of loyal and scared enough to not try anything (Loyalty 95%), but they are a little wild when let loose (Controllability 60%). The math would be 50 (Allies 5)×.88×.95×.6= 25.08 × (Leadership 5) 2.5 = 62.7, rounded to 63.)
Connections (7/level)
Prerequisites: Charisma 10, Social Interaction (Small Talk/Information Gathering)
You know people. Whenever you attempt to gather information or find a kind of merchant, you may add your level of Connections as a bonus to the skill results. 
If you pass, one of your contacts lives in the town you are in and has a friendly disposition towards you.

Hospitality (10)
Prerequisites: Charisma 15 or Obligation to the organization
Thanks to who you are or what you do, people will offer you room and board and some basic supplies. Each Hospitality should affect a different organization. 
Frequency of Appearance: This is expressed as a percentage and acts as a multiplier for the cost. A Hospitality provider that is magically omnipresent or truely globally pervasive is 100%. A group with far flung outposts and resources spread around the campaign area would be 60% and you multiply the cost by 0.6. A group with a base in one city out of a hundred in the setting would be 1% and you multiply the cost by 0.01. Your GM rolls at or under the frequency of appearance at the beginning of each session. Hospitality is not available on a failure.
Patronage
Social Status
Authority


Magic FX

Step 5: Limitations

Limitations are what give your character flavor and make them more than just statistics. 

In many point based games, Limitations would give you extra points to spend on more abilities, and that would necessitate a limitation on how many limitations to apply.

Bahb’s d100 system does not give you points for limitations. Instead they represent extra advancement opportunities. As such, a character is still limited on how many limitations to have.

Each Limitation comes with a value. This represents two different things. Firstly, it is counted as a % bonus to earned Advancement Points. Second, you earn Advancement Points equal to the value when your Limitation comes up.

If a player doesn’t want their limitation anymore, a Game Master should provide a way to overcome it. This will not always be easy. As a general rule, for the session you remove the Limitation, you reverse the Limitation (deduct AP instead of adding AP)

Debt (1/level)
You owe someone money. Every month you must make a payment of 1% of your starting wealth for each level of debt. This represents a minimum payment on the debt. If you don’t pay, someone will come take your valuables. A character who starts with more money has more expensive debt.

Removal: Debts are typically tied to a loan of some sort, and these are typically 50-100 times the monthly payment. Some debts may represent things more complicated than loans (alimony, child support, startup costs, medical payments for you or your dependants or allies, etc)

Moral Code (varies)
You don’t do certain things because you personally object to it or follow a religious or philosophical concept that prohibits it.

A tithe would be a sort of debt, while mandatory church appearance would be an obligation, instead of moral code. Both would be appropriate on top of a moral code.

Examples: doesn’t steal (10), cannot own people (5), celibate (5), doesn’t kill (15), doesn’t worship other gods (5), doesn’t cheat when gambling (2), always bargains fairly (5),

Greedy (1/level)
You have a hard time resisting wealth. Whenever presented with an opportunity for gain, you must pass a willpower test or make an attempt to appropriate the wealth. The target number is what percentage of your starting money the opportunity provides TIMES your level of Greedy.

(Example: a character with greedy 4 and starting money 1,000 is presented with a dragon hoard valued at 1,000,000. His willpower save target is 400,000 and he ain’t passing up the opportunity)

Fearful (10/level)
You are a coward.

Whenever you take damage, you must make a willpower test with a target number (level of fearful x damage taken) or rout (take no action but run away from whoever hurt you for a number of minutes equal to your rate of failure)

Whenever someone intimidates you, they get to add your level of Fearful to the test as a bonus. Whenever someone casts a morale spell or activates a morale effect, they may add your level of Fearful to the test as a bonus.

Easily Sick (10/level)
Whenever you could suffer from poisoning, disease, or magical weakness, you subtract your level of Easily Sick from the fortitude test as a penalty.

You add your level of easily sick in days to any recovery times for incapacitation or illness effects.

Obsession
Something takes up a lot of your thoughts. Maybe it's a person, place, or thing. Maybe it's an idea or an invention.

Easy to Kill (10/level)
Don’t get hurt. You die easily.

For each level of easy to kill you add +1 to the target number for any survival checks to avoid dying.

For each level of easy to kill, it increases the range of automatic failure by 1 ( ie easy to kill 1 dies on a nat 1 or 2, easy to kill 9 dies on a nat 1-10)

Loyalty (2/level)
Whenever you would act against someone the GM considers you loyal to, you must make a willpower test. The target number depends on how ‘close’ you are emotionally to the target of betrayal, and each level of loyalty applies a -1 penalty to the test.

Obligation (20)
You have a job you can’t walk away from, a wookie life-debt, a crime family or gang you answer to, or something similar.

A dual agent or crooked cop or similar character types might have multiple competing obligations.

If multiple characters in a group have the same obligation (a navy seal team who also act as paranormal investigators) and it activates for one, it activates for everyone with that obligation.

Modifiers:

Frequency of appearance: this is a number between 1-100 and represents how often your obligation is called on in percentages. The baseline is 50%. To calculate the modifier take the percentage as a decimal and add 0.5 to that. Then multiply the points for obligation by that amount. (Examples: 1% is a x0.51 multiplier, 50% is a x1, 100% is x1.5)

Risk: This represents how likely the obligation is to cause the character non-lethal problems if they fail (jail time, loss of authority or status, etc) and is expressed as a percentage. The baseline is 50%. To calculate the modifier take the percentage as a decimal and add 0.5 to that. Then multiply the points for obligation by that amount. (Examples: 1% is a x0.51 multiplier, 50% is a x1, 100% is x1.5)

Lethality: This is the chance that the hazard in completing the task is deadly. The baseline is 0%. To calculate the modifier take the percentage as a decimal and add 1 to that. Then multiply the points for obligation by that amount. (Examples: 1% is a x1.01 multiplier, 50% is a x1.5, 100% is x2)

(Sample: A swat officer is only called in when patrol officers encounter a hazard or tactical entry for a warrant is required. Oftentimes they have a normal job in a police force unless it is a major city. Messing up gets you fired, in grevious cases arrested, and you often have people trying to kill you.

Frequency: 15% (once a week) (x0.65)
Risk: 90% (x1.4)
Lethality: 50% (x1.5)

Final total: 27.3 rounded to 27)



Delusions (varies)

Mostly harmless delusions are worth 1-5 points. They don’t materially affect your day to day life much, and won’t likely harm you (example: healing power of crystals, essential oils, dandelion roots cure cancer,  etc)

Somewhat hazardous delusions that could lead to dangerous results are worth 6-20 points. They will affect your day to day life and may convince you to do stupid things. (Examples: lizard men control the government, dandelion roots cure cancer when you have cancer)

Delusions that are clearly not going to end well are worth 30-40 points (I can fly, I’m bulletproof)

Intolerance (10/level)
You don’t like people. Maybe it's just one grouping of people, or non-humans in a species diverse setting. Or your character is classically backward: sexist, racist, classist, nationalist.

Whenever presented with a trigger to practice or preach your flawed ideology of intolerance, you must pass a Willpower check with a Target number of 100 and a penalty equal to your level of intolerance. If you fail, you must act accordingly (‘Oh come on guys, it’s just a bunch of squaws’ When they outnumber you 20 to 1 and all seem to have revolvers to your muzzleloader.)

Target Frequency: Specific to the setting the characters are playing in (global figures only matter in a globe hopping game, galactic figures only matter when you’re crossing the galaxy) what percentage of the population is the character intolerant toward? (Examples: Misogynists and Militant Feminists would be targeting 49-51% of about any population…. Maybe less or more if you spend most of the campaign on an 18th century sailing ship or in the middle of any warzone). The baseline for this is 25%, and you add 0.75 to the decimal of the percentage as a modifier.

Level of Intolerance: This is a % rating between 100 (kill them all) through 50 (they don’t have rights and should be property) to as low as 1(‘my uncle said I shouldn’t trust your kind’) The baseline for this is 25%, and you add 0.75 to the decimal of the percentage as a modifier.

(Example: A classic misogynist believes fathers should own their daughters and husbands should own their wives, but that they do have some sort of basic rights (particularly as widows)

Intolerance- Sexist 3
Target Frequency: 51% (slightly more females than males in the world as normal) (x1.26)
Intolerance Level: 45% (x1.2)
Total: 45.36 (45))

Allergy(varies)
Something causes you to break into hives or enter shock and possibly even die!
There are two components to Allergy. Frequency and Severity.
Frequency: Something you cannot avoid (air) is 100 points. Something that severely limits your movement approximately half the time (daylight) is 50 points. Staple food items (wheat, eggs, milk, rice) are 25 points. Food items or materials will be 5-20 points unless particularly rare. Silver, gold, uranium or blood of a sacrificial virgin would be 1-4 points.

Severity:
Hives: Fortitude test target 100 or lose half initiative for exposure duration plus 4 hours due to itching. Reroll test every hour of exposure. 5 points
Damage: As Hives but reroll every minute, plus another Fortitude test target 150 or you take 2d4 unsoakable damage per minute of exposure. Reroll test every minute of exposure. 20 points
System Failure: As Damage, plus another Fortitude test target 200 or die instantly. Reroll test every minute of exposure. 50 points

Example: A vampire takes damage from garlic. Garlic is a common enough food ingredient (hard to avoid in a 20th century kitchen) 20 points for frequency, and it does damage for 20 points. Total: 40 points. For sunlight it's system failure and sunlight is the example of 50 for a total of 100.

Dependance

Maintenance
Someone has to perform regular maintenance on you or you will die. Perhaps you’re a robot or cyborg, or need regular medical attention.

Your GM and you should decide on the appropriate maintenance skill.

Every week, someone other than the character must roll a skill test for the maintenance skill with a target equal to (Constitution + Maintenance) or they lose (Maintenance level) Hit Points and cannot regain any Hit Points until there is a successful maintenance test.

Dependents/Family

Addiction

Injury

Odious Habit (varies)
You do something society frowns on.
Eats People (30)
Sacrifices Living Creatures (20)
Public Intoxication (10)

Weakness

Low Status (varies)
You are a non-citizen, serf, or slave with less rights than a normal member of the dominant society in the campaign.
Non-citizen: You cannot appeal to the courts or laws when wronged. You are free to leave, and often encouraged to do so. 5 points
Serf: you have some limited access to courts, but you cannot leave your home area without permission from a local ruler. 7 points
Slave: you are someone else’s property. If you do what you want instead of what your owner wants, your owner has the legal right to punish you. 15 points.

Unusual Appearance (varies)
You look weird. Either you aren’t human, have a mutation, deformity or poorly healed wound, or otherwise stick out in a crowd- an albino or extremely rare minority.
Albinism (20)
Pointed Ears (5)
Unusual Skin color (5)
Unusual hair color (3)
Unusual eye color (2)
Unusual teeth (3)
Unusual limb configuration (10)

Chapter 2: Tactical Movement & Combat
The d100 system uses real world measurements to determine distance and time.

A combat turn is a minute long. During that turn, characters will act in an order based on their Initiative Derived Statistic. 
At any time, one character is active, and may use any ability. Other characters are limited to defensive responses.
Each action in a combat turn is represented by a technique/maneuver or combination of maneuvers which reduces your Initiative Derived Statistic. 
The character with the highest remaining total acts next, until everyone has exhausted that combat turn’s supply of Initiative.
Optionally, you can also have characters roll a dice to add to their Initiative Statistic.

Maneuvers represent a character’s actions. How complex that is really depends on your game. 
If you’re going for a pretty basic dungeon crawler, you may go with a smaller number of basic maneuvers and then add spells on top with each spell technique requiring a FX to use. Or, if you’re trying to imitate Wuxia or side scrolling fighting games, you're going to have a few dozen techniques for punches and kicks alone, and more behind FX gatekeeping.

Whether or not your character can chain techniques together before passing, and exactly which ones they can chain and under which circumstances is a concept referred to as comboing, and is an important concept for determining flavor and game balance.

When one character attacks another they roll against either a passive defense (a set number) or an active defense (an opposing roll). The defending player can choose an active defense after the attacking player rolls their skill (so you know if it beats any passive defense) but before damage is calculated.

There should be penalties to skill rolls for distance, cover, lighting, and other situations that might affect the ability to hit.

Damage for an attack maneuver can be a fixed number for simplicity, or you can find a way to make use of all the other polyhedral dice you probably own. But the basic idea is that getting a raise on the skill roll should allow more damage.

A character can move during a maneuver. If the total moved in a round exceeds the characters movement statistic, they must pay some other resource statistic to move.
Sample Game

Combat works in time periods of one minute at a scale of meters or yards (at your choice, they’re close enough to not matter for a tabletop game)

At the beginning of each minute, every character’s initiative refreshes.

The character with the highest Initiative is the active character. They may choose one or more  techniques to perform and then spend initiative for it. You may only perform multiple techniques as part of a combo.
Characters other than the active character can only spend initiative in response to the active player's action- to perform an active defense or countermagic most often.
After the active character has performed a technique or combo, check to see which character has the highest remaining initiative.  That is the new active character. 
Once all characters in combat have run out of Initiative, start combat over and one full minute has passed.

Attack techniques inflict damage. Each technique (or weapon) has a starting damage level described by a dice type and a value (IE 1d4, 2d6, 4d8). You may add a dice of damage or increase the die type with each raise. Certain techniques will also allow other effects with a raise.

The dice type stages for damage are as follows:

1
D2
D4
D6
D8
D10
D12
D20

Melee Attacks and Thrown weapons add 1 point of Damage for each full 10 points of Strength the attacking character possesses. 
Magical attacks add 1 point of Damage for each full 10 points of Magic the attacking character possesses.

Damage has several types. Those are:
-Bludgeoning (b)
-Cutting ©
-Piercing (p)
-Thermal (cold, hot, electricity all produce similar wounds) (t)
-Magic (m) (magical effects that don’t fit into above categories- magic swords cut, magic arrows pierce, magic fire burns)
-Other (diseases, poisons, oxygen deprivation) (o)

Ranged attacks have a distance penalty applied. Every full 5 yards or meters is -1 to skill tests. 

A penalty of -1 to -100 applies to any ranged attack that has obscured line of sight (firing through trees, at someone behind breastworks, hiding behind an interior wall) 

Moving targets are harder to hit. For every 5 Move a character has done in the current minute of combat, the penalty to hit them (melee or ranged) with any technique other than Receive Charge is -1.

You cannot throw an object more than (Strength divided by its weight in kilograms) meters or less if it is not aerodynamic. If it is aerodynamic, double the throwing distance. (A giant can just throw a tree, but one trimmed down to a caber will fly farther. A football shaped object will fly further than an irregularly shaped rock of the same weight.)

Very low lighting conditions, smoke, or fog that influence visibility apply a penalty to all combat rolls. The same sort of penalty to attack applies to impaired vision. In total darkness, smoke you cannot see past 1 foot, or completely blind, you suffer a -100 penalty. In daylight overcast conditions or mist or fog that reduces visibility to over 3 miles has no penalty unless these conditions apply all at once (a overcast sky with light smoke and wind in your eyes might equate to -3 to -10)

Stance: You can be prone/belly crawling, sitting, kneeling/hands and knees, crouching or standing. Each one has different effects. Lower is harder to move, but easier to avoid line of sight (better cover)

Facing: Imagine each character has an invisible stop sign (octagon) underneath them. You may attack in front of you, to the front right, or the front left. You may attack out to the side in Melee on the side you are holding your weapon. Otherwise you have to turn your facing to be able to hit a target.

Survive: Once you are at negative Hit Points, you must make a Survive roll every minute, and every time you take additional damage. The roll is 1d100+Constitution against a target number of your negative Hit Points. If you roll a 1, you die regardless of your Constitution. Your negative Hit Points are also a penalty on any other skill test you attempt.

Chapter 3: Non Combat World Interaction


Strategic Movement
You may move a number of miles equal to your Basic Move in an 8 hour day's march. (Or twice that number in kilometers at your preference)
Your Basic Move is reduced by 1 for this purpose for each 10 kilograms of weight you are carrying.

You may increase the distance with an athletics(marching [pace]) check, adding one mile to the march for each raise. You may reduce the carrying penalty with an athletics (marching [load]) check, reducing the effective carry weight by 10 kilos for each raise.

As a group, this is determined by the lowest Basic Move.

For each 10 Fatigue you spend, you may move an additional mile.  You may reduce this cost with an athletics(marching[endurance]) check. For each raise, it costs 1 less Fatigue per mile, to a minimum of 1 Fatigue per mile.

If you attempt to march twice in a day, the second march costs 5 Fatigue to start and any additional Fatigue costs are doubled. You will also not be able to recover any Fatigue until you have rested for at least 16 hours.

Lifting & Carrying

You can carry 2 kilograms (or 4 pounds) per point of Strength. 
Attempting to carry more than this costs 1 Hit Point 1 Initiative, and 1 Fatigue per minute per 2 kilos. This only applies if you are moving.

You can lift up to 5 kilograms (or 10 pounds) per point of Strength, and hold that up for a minute per point of Constitution. 
For each 5 kilos or fraction more than the maximum you attempt to lift, it costs 1 Hit Point, 1 Initiative, and 1 Fatigue per minute and reduces the amount of time you can hold it by 1 minute.

Rest and Recovery
Unless otherwise limited, you recover 1 Fatigue per full 10 points of (Strength + Constitution) per hour of rest of light activity (cooking, light crafting, strolling, or shopping as long as you carry less than 10 kilos).

Unless otherwise limited, you recover your Physical Soak in Hit Points every hour after the 8th hour of rest or light activity.

Unless otherwise limited, you recover your Magical Soak in Mana every hour after the 8th hour of rest or light activity. 

Care from a healer can accelerate the recovery of Fatigue and Hit Points. For each recovery period, a raise equals an additional point of recovery. 

Resting at a Dragon Line or Place of Power allows you to recover additional Mana every hour equal to the Mana available at that Place.

Information Gathering
At the most basic level, Information Gathering is what you do when you walk into the tavern and ask the barkeep about any adventuring jobs available.

It could also be more complicated than that. 

Most basic social interactions can be simple open tests, unless someone is wanting to keep secrets. The party wanting to keep a secret is not necessarily the person the character is interacting with.

Influence and Opinion
Who are your friends? Who likes you, who dislikes you, and who has never heard of you?

Bartering

‘You cannot go to Wal*Mart and barter for a better price.’

When it makes sense to be able to do so, a negotiation contest can adjust pricing. For each raise the winner of the contest gets, they may adjust a price in their favor by 10%, or they may adjust another term of a contract in their favor.

Crafting
Crafting is often a series of open tests to process down raw materials and create a final product.

As a default, a character can process and generate resources equal to 1% of their starting wealth each hour. The crafting character must have appropriate materials by purchasing them or collecting them otherwise.

For each raise on the appropriate skill check, either increase the value generated by 10% or decrease the time it takes to complete the task by 1 hour.

Follow logical processes. 

Example: If you have a buffalo to process, you’re going to skin it, butcher it, tan the hide, collect bones, horns, ivory and sinew. Then you will cook and/or dry the meat, possibly render fat and produce pemmican. Maybe you’ll turn the hide into a tent or saddle or apparel. You might steam the ivory and flatten it for an inlay for a handle, or you might carve it into a tool. Each of these tasks is one or more skill rolls.

Organizations and PCs

The characters might belong to an organization. Their interactions with these organizations will be governed by patronage and obligations, as described in FX and Limitations respectively.

Regular Jobs

The character might keep down a day job waiting tables or pushing papers between adventures.

Each job has at least one requisite skill, and often several. Each time the work results matter for the character’s regular job, they make an open skill test against the lowest prerequisite they have.

Each job has a rate of pay. Some jobs pay more to the wealthy. Some jobs pay more if you get raises in skill tests. Some jobs may provide both kinds of varied pay.

Each job has a time requirement. Some jobs may allow you to reduce the time they take if you get raises on the skill test.

Downtime
When a character gets downtime, the group is waiting for something, or working on something that doesn't require all their waking time. 

Your game master may also apply downtime rules to progress in game time in a predictable manner 

(Example: monster of the week campaigns, particularly those with seasonal themed monsters would do to sync the game weeks to real world weeks. Downtime rules would apply between each session normally.)

It is highly recommended to progress downtime in increments of weeks, but it can be broken down to individual days when needed.

There are 168 hours in a week. A normal person needs 56 of those hours for sleep. Someone with a day job has more hours of the day spoken for already. If you’re helping on a project, that will take up some of the time.

What can you do with your downtime? Anything the GM says is okay. Use of the crafting skill will be common, as will study (see Advancement pg xx). 





Chapter 4: Advancement

Advancement Points are something characters earn by overcoming opponents and obstacles, as well as for playing in character.

When you earn 100 Advancement Points, you redeem them for an advance.

On each advance you apply 10% each of your current attribute points, skill points, and specialty/fx points. You may move each rank of points downward like you did at creation. Like at creation, you may not retain any points past the point you advance. Spend them all.

You may also advance a skill or specialty through Study. 
Each skill and specialty has its own total of Study Points.

Hitting The Nail

Whenever a character rolls exactly the number they need to pass a skill test (or tie in the case of an opposed test) that character immediately gains 1 point in one stage of that skill. If this was a critically timed success against the boss enemy give the point to the tied attribute. Otherwise, apply the point at the skill or some level of specialty.

Study & Training

When you have time to spare for such niceties as downtime, you may choose to study or practice a skill or specialty.

Every 4 hours of study for a skill earns a Study Point for that skill. For specialties and subspecialties, follow the same rules as for character creation (4 hours of study on a specialty earns you 4 Study Points, a first layer subspecialty 8 Study Points, etc)
Every 100 Study Points, you may redeem it for a 1 point increase in that skill or specialty.

An instructor may give a 1.5 hour lesson on a skill as part of the 4 hours of study. If the instructor has a superior skill value and passes a skill check, the studying character may add any raises the instructor earned on the skill check to the Study Points they earned that period. An instructor may give these bonus points to a class of students equal to the most appropriate basic attribute.

Job

A character may or may not work between risking their life on adventure. Or maybe that's even their real job.

Depending on the setting or time period, there may or may not be your choice of jobs in whatever area you’re in. 

For every 16 hours of work, you may gain 1 Study Point for a prerequisite skill for the Job you are working.

Overcoming Opposition
When you defeat an enemy, you compare their points to the group's average points. For someone who matches exactly, overcoming them in a combat setting is worth 10 AP. Otherwise, consult the guide below.
Weight: A life or death struggle is worth a x1 multiplier. An event that affects only finances and then less than 1% of the parties average starting wealth is a x0.01 multiplier. 
Stage 1: (Enemy Points / Party Average)×2
Stage 2: (Enemy Points / Party Average)x2
Stage 3: (Enemy Points / Party Average)x2
Stage 4: Enemy Points / Party Average
Subspecialties and Limitations don’t matter much for AP calculation. If they come up, the GM should ad hoc a minor adjustment.

The French territory in West Africa is small compared to the British and Italian possessions in the region.
It is, however, well positioned for the French, and the rest of the world to trade with Abyssinia. Halle Salese is interested in anything to help him keep the militant italians from subsuming his kingdom. Arms at the most basic level, but rumors about magical relics and ancient holy artifacts with supposed miraculous or demonic powers also coming to the markets of Djibouti have persisted amongst the various esoteric lodges of europe and the americas.

The last remnants of the world's free companies and a steady stream of adventuresome young men looking to sell their services to one of the combatants in the upcoming war are also gathering in both French and British somaliland.

The markets of the port of Djibouti smell of coffee, spices, and livestock. But one can catch wiffs of gunpowder and brimstone if they seek them out.



Abyssinia
